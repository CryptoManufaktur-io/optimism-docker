# Overview

Docker Compose for OP Stack chains: Optimism, Base, PGN, Zora.

`cp default.env .env`, then `nano .env` and adjust values for the right network including sequencer. On op-mainnet,
set a snapshot; on other networks, optionally set a snapshot.

Meant to be used with [central-proxy-docker](https://github.com/CryptoManufaktur-io/central-proxy-docker) for traefik
and Prometheus remote write; use `:ext-network.yml` in `COMPOSE_FILE` inside `.env` in that case.

If you want the op-geth RPC ports exposed locally, use `op-shared.yml` in `COMPOSE_FILE` inside `.env`.

`legacy.yml` runs the legacy l2geth on Optimism, set `LEGACY=true` in `.env` for that. You probably
[don't need it](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bedrock/node-operator-guide/#historical-execution-vs-historical-data-routing).

Multiple Optimism Docker stacks all connected to the same central traefik will work, as long as they all use a
different `NETWORK`. See the `aliases` in `optimism.yml`.

The `./optd` script can be used as a quick-start:

`./optd install` brings in docker-ce, if you don't have Docker installed already.

`cp default.env .env`

`nano .env` and adjust variables as needed, particularly `NETWORK` and `SNAPSHOT` and `SEQUENCER`

`./optd up`

To update the software, run `./optd update` and then `./optd up`

This is Optimism Docker v3.0.0
